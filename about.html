			The world of information will expand infinitely for some time to come. 
			And just like the humans who create these websites, not everyone helps.
			The webs effective searchability is decreasing
			as the volume of low-quality information grows.

				Our mission
				</strong> 
				<br>
				<br>
				Our mission is to provide a low-tech yet high quality platform. The goal is to retain a timely and relevant collection
				of information sources available. This will be achieved by dedicating manpower to the "sort and destroy" method.
				We want our users to have high expectations every time they come back. Why? Because we hold the information directory to high standards too. 
				Go discover anything using our premium directory. Made by the best informationists in the world.

			Discover high-quality information using the premium directory where we've taken the time to filter billions
			of websites out leaving you with only the best of the best.

				Google and I are like brothers, we grew up together. Anytime I question something
				Google has an answer. I entered my first search query at eight years old.
				Now it's been 20 years of daily Googling. 
				That's why I want to organize a directory to help others.
